# Notes

- Commit fairseq-formatted manifests into repo for posterity.
- Paths are relative to `/workspace`, e.g. `/workspace/data/manifests/finetune_punjabi-1h/audio`, because we will assume all scripts are being run inside the `fauxneticien/fairseq-asr` Docker container (see `docker-compose.yaml` for the volume mounting configuration)
