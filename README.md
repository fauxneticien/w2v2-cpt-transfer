# Predicting positive transfer for improved low-resource speech recognition using acoustic pseudo-tokens

## About

In this project, we are interested in 1) whether mixing in data from a similar, higher-resource 'donor' language during continued pre-training of wav2vec 2.0 XLSR-128 helps improve downstream word error rate on a target language and 2) how we can predict how (un)helpful various donor languages are for a given target language.
